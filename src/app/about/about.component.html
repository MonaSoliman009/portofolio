                I graduated from  faculty of Engineering-computers and systems department-.
                 After graduation, I studied at ITI-Information technology institute- web development using Mean Stack,
                  I graduated from it. I really love to code and make responsive web pages to help companies 
                  and individuals grow their work.
I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.
