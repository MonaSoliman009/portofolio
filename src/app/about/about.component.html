            <p>
        


                I graduated from the faculty of Engineering ( computers and systems department ).
                 After graduation, I studied at ITI ( Information technology institute) web development using Mean Stack,
                  I graduated from it. I really love to code and make responsive web pages to help companies 
                  and individuals grow their work.
